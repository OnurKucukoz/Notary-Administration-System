The Notary Administration System is designed to make it easy for clients to get information about 
the status of work files and show the necessary documents to the customer before they come to the 
notary office. In addition the system has a appointment module for long proceses such as 
inheritence process. The aim of the system is solving the long waiting time at the notaryâ€™s office.
